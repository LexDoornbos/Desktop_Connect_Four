# Desktop_Connect_Four
Training project from Hyperskill.org - Java Backend Developer course. 

It's a game of Connect Four using Java Swing GUI.

Working on stage 4/4 of the project (forgot to make a repo from the start of stage 1)

TODO: 
  - add a check after each player's turn to see if there are four connecting pieces (horizontal / vertical / diagonal)
  - in case of a win: highlight the four connecting cells.
